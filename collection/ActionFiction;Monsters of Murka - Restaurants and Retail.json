								"This time around, we're going to step away from the broad-scope, political world of the Monsters of Murka core book and talk about something that has defined Murkan culture since the very beginning: Capitalism! Personally, it's a favorite of mine, so I recommend it, 10 OUT OF 10, every time!!",
								"Restaurants & Retail has everything you could ever want to help you and your companions navigate the commercial world of Murka. We have subclasses, spells, wacky new items, we've even got monsters to guarantee you'll never sleep peacefully again\u2014and we're just getting started!",
								"Go on a fantastic voyage to some of the greatest places in the kingdom: places where the free market lives on! You'll go to the restuaropolis of Flavor City, home to the mighty and bodacious Guillame Fierre and his Paladins of Flavor. Here you'll fight sentient food, cook up new spells, and sample some of the greatest cuisine ever conceived of by sapient life. I mean, the food here is literally OUT OF THIS WORLD.",
								"Next, we'll take you to the City in A Bottle, the Hall of Murka! This world-withinwalls is run by a living legend, the gigantic folk hero Tall Hammertoe. You'll meet other fantastic characters like the prankster duo Jey and The Silent Tongue, and Ratinim, a spymaster who dreams of revenge.",
								"The Hall of Murka offers up some of the best in merchandise, underground housing, and horrors from the deep! Leave those pesky morals at home, because here, capital is king.",
								"BUT I'M NOT DONE YET! After you depart the Hall of Murka, you'll travel to one of the strangest places yet! Within Murka lives a virulent cancer known as Walmoria: a truly gargantuan superstore that not only dips underground, but we're pretty sure it dips into lost demiplanes and other universes\u2014 but we literally cannot confirm that! There's a whole new set of rules for handling just how deep it can get its claws into the heart and mind of the most stalwart of heroes. Walmoria is so weird, I actually doubled over, and threw up just inside the door!",
								"That's right! Walmoria is so capitalistic it made me, the god of commerce, sick to my core! So sick that if you send a writwit RIGHT NOW, I'll include an autographed copy of my holy hospital bills alongside your copy of Monsters of Murka: Restaurants & Retail! That's an incredible deal!",
								"BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER! Every location chapter in this book includes adventure hooks, notes from your favorite characters, and alternative rules suggestions! All of this is on top of the endless hours of parody and commentary infused into every paragraph on every page.",
								"This is your front row seat to see a culture so obsessed with money that they made ME one of their gods!"
